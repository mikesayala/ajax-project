# Anime Watchers

A web application for anime enthusiasts who want to watch anime, but don't know
which ones to watch.

I built this app because I know the struggle of wanting to watch a specific anime
genre but not knowing a specific title. It randomizes an anime and once I find one
I like I can save it to a watch list.
